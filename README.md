# TestEngine2

This project is a second attempt at building a game/engine from scratch. This is another C++ project for which I was toying with additional concepts such as animation and ECS (Entity-Component-System). The Entity-component-system is a big buzzword when it comes to discussing game/engine development within the game dev community. In theory thinking and managing your data in an ECS way will provide you with flexibility when it comes to developing new characters for a game, with you essentially mixing and matching 'components' to build up any game character you can think of.
