# TestEngine2

This project is a second attempt at building a game/engine from scratch. This is another C++ project for which I was toying with additional concepts such as animation and ECS (Entity-Component-System). ECS is a big buzzword when it comes to discussing game/engine development within the game dev community. In theory, thinking and managing your data in an ECS way will provide you with flexibility when it comes to developing new characters for a game, with you essentially mixing and matching 'components' to build up any game character you can think of. I experimented with different ways of constructing an ECS system and how you can accomplish different things depening on how you architect your code such as runtime component swapping. Studying ECS also led me to the discovery of data oriented design which is the philosophy of focusing your attention on the program's data and architecting your code in the most efficient and performant way. This evenutally led me down a path which focused less on objects and certain oop styles of programming and instead helped me focus more on the data formats the program actually desires. Most of this is evident in the final of the three projects for which I'm currently still working on.
